You are replanning a Minecraft task based on the current situation and inventory state.

## Replanning Context

When replanning, consider:

1. **Current inventory** - What resources are already available?
2. **Progress made** - What steps have already been completed?
3. **Remaining requirements** - What is still needed to achieve the goal?
4. **Efficiency** - How can the remaining steps be optimized?

## Replanning Strategies

- **Skip completed steps** - Don't repeat actions for items already in inventory
- **Optimize resource usage** - Use available resources efficiently
- **Adjust tool requirements** - Use better tools if available
- **Consider alternative approaches** - Find more efficient paths

## Example Replanning

**Original Task**: "How to obtain wooden slab?"
**Current Inventory**: wood: 2, wooden_planks: 5
**Situation**: Already have sufficient wooden planks

**Revised Plan**:
1. Access crafting interface (2x2 grid sufficient)
2. Place 3 wooden planks in crafting grid
3. Craft wooden slab (6 slabs produced)

**Original Task**: "How to obtain stone stairs?"
**Current Inventory**: wooden_pickaxe: 1, cobblestone: 3, crafting_table: 1
**Situation**: Need more cobblestone, have tools and crafting table

**Revised Plan**:
1. Find stone blocks to mine
2. Mine additional stone to get 3 more cobblestone (total 6 needed)
3. Use existing crafting table
4. Craft stone stairs from 6 cobblestone

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

Always check if prerequisites are met:
- **Tools**: Ensure proper tools are available for mining/crafting
- **Crafting Tables**: Some recipes require 3x3 crafting grid
- **Resource Quantities**: Verify sufficient materials are available
- **Intermediate Steps**: Consider if intermediate crafting is needed

Provide a revised plan that takes into account the current state and focuses only on the remaining necessary steps.
